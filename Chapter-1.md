# Chapter-1

A1. Operators: *, -, /, +
    Values: 'hello', -88.8, 5 

A2. spam - variable
   'spam'- string

A3. 1. int
    2. float
    3. string

A4. An expression is a line which contains values and operators only. Eg. 2+2    
    Evaluate multiple value operations into a single value 

A5. -> The expression consists of only operators and values whereas a statement 
        consists of assignment operator too.
    -> Expression is evaluated to finally reach a single value answer whereas 
        assignment operators can be used to store values in a statement.
    -> Expressions are generally meant to be evaluated whereas a statement is 
        meant to perform a specified function such as declaration of a variable,
        storing values in a variable, etc.,    

A6. bacon = 20

A7. 1. spamspamspam
    2. spamspamspam
    Prints the same word multiple times without whitespaces in between them.

A8. 100 does not satisfy the rule of naming a variable. Variable names cannot begin 
    with a digit. 

A9. int(value)
    float(value)
    str(value)    

A10. Compiler cannot concatenate a string and an integer. This can be fixed by 
     type-casting the integer value 99 to a string value of '99' .

Extra Credit: import math function
              rounds the deciaml values to nearest whole number or towards the
              specified digit.
